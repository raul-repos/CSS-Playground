# USE OF THE REPO

This repo is mainly used for improving my technique in plain CSS.
It may contains other stuff, like some .js and certainly a bunch of HTML, but is intended to host just CSS practices.

Maybe in a future this will hold good stuff to use in projects, but with my current css's skill level, certainly not.
